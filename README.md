> Easily mock routing interactions in your Vue 3 apps

## Installation

```sh
yarn add vue-router-mock@4
# or
npm install vue-router-mock@2
```

## Usage

### Stubs

By default, both `<router-link>` and `<router-view>` are stubbed but you can override them locally. This is specially useful when you have nested `<router-view>` and you rely on them for a test:

```js
const wrapper = mount(MyComponent, {
  global: {
    stubs: { RouterView: MyNestedComponent },
  },
})
```
